- Happens after failing to find commands or complying with requests.

### Focus

- Changes verboseness of messages, makes isla care less.

## States

### Frustrated/fed up

- May take a second more to respond to commands
- Random error messages
  - Still run stuff like normal
- Emotion change boost 2x
- Angry isla images

### Satisfied

- Happiness/hug images

### Distracted

- Randomly fail requests to isla

### Focused

- Give verbose logs of what is going on

## Requests to isla

- SSH
  - Have isla handle ssh and authentication

## Future

- Self replication
